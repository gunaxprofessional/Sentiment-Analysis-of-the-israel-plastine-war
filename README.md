# Analyzing Sentiments and Geopolitical Stances in Reddit Comments on Gaza-Palestine Conflict

## Introduction:

This project delves into the world of online discourse surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict. The goal is to analyze Reddit comments to decipher the sentiments and geopolitical stances of users participating in these discussions. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project embarks on a multifaceted journey.

## 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:

- The project starts by loading Reddit comments from a CSV file and employs rigorous data cleaning methods. This includes removing URLs, HTML tags, special characters, and employing lemmatization for text normalization.

## 2. Sentiment Analysis:

- Utilizing the VADER sentiment analysis tool, the project assesses the emotional tone of each comment. Four key sentiment metrics—Compound, Positive, Negative, and Neutral—are computed, offering a nuanced understanding of user sentiments.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis:

- Through visualization techniques like density plots and word clouds, the project visually represents sentiment distributions. This helps identify prevailing positive, negative, and neutral sentiments within the dataset.

## 4. Topic Modeling:

- Employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular topic modeling technique, the project uncovers latent topics within the comments. This step aids in comprehending the underlying themes that dominate the discussions.

## 5. Geopolitical Stance Classification:

- By combining sentiment scores and dominant topics, the project classifies comments into distinct geopolitical stances. Users are categorized based on their sentiments—support for Israel, support for Palestine, opposition to Israel/Palestine, or a neutral stance where the user's position remains ambiguous.

## 6. Insights and Conclusions:

- Through this in-depth analysis, the project gains valuable insights into the sentiments and geopolitical inclinations prevalent in Reddit discussions on the Israel-Palestine conflict. This exploration sheds light on the diverse opinions within the online community, providing a comprehensive overview of public sentiment.
